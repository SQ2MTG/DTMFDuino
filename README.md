DTMFDuino receives DTMF tones through a MT8870 integrated circuit who converts the analog audio of tones to a binary code understandable by the microcontroller. The 
microcontroller runs Arduino bootloader and converts the received codes to actions (turn on and off some outputs), also the system has the option to know the current state 
of each output.
